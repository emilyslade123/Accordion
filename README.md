The aim is to combine all the cards into a single pile. Combine cards by moving a card either 1 or 3 spaces to the left onto a matching card (with either the same suit or the same rank or both). Use the Move hints to display all possible moves. Use the Suit and Rank hints to display all cards of a given suit or rank.
